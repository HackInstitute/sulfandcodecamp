        We took our intense two day full-time workshop and split it in half - giving you four days (Mo.-Thu.) of React workshop plus another day for a react native introduction (Fr.). The surfing lessons take place from Tuesday to Saturday during the morning hours. The rest of the weekend is reserved for the hackathon before we will leave on Sunday.
