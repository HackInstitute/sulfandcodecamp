          <p>
            All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our workshop are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

          	<h3>The Quick Version</h3>
          	<p>Our workshop is dedicated to providing a harassment-free workshop experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of workshop participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any workshop venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Workshop participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the Workshop without a refund at the discretion of the workshop organisers.</p>

          	<h3>The Less Quick Version</h3>
          	<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
          	<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
          	<p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.</p>
          	<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the workshop organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the workshop with no refund.</p>
          	<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of organizers staff immediately. Organizers can be identified as they'll be wearing branded clothing and/or badges.</p>
          	<p>Workshop organizers will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the workshop. We value your attendance.</p>
          	<p>We expect participants to follow these rules at workshop venue and workshop-related social events.
